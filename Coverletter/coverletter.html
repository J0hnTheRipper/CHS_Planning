        <p>Dear Mr.John Doe,</p>
        <p> It came to my attention that the Kumon Assistant position is avaliable for most people. 
          Your notice on the www.indeed.com website have worked. As you are well aware, there's 
          over 26  applicants applying for the job. Out of all the applicants, there's a reason
          why you will pick me over others to be the sole assistant of the Kumon Program. </p>
        <p>It was a long time ago, but Kumon was a place where I would attend weekly. I have 
          gotten a bit too reliant on caculators, and my grades start suffering from the
          "no-caculator-rule". Thanks to the people that worked there, it wasn't too much of
            a hassle for me to finish tests. Now in high school, I would like to help 
        people face through whatever difficulties math have to offer.  </p>
        <p> I believe I met the qualifification of the job. I have a good comprehension of math,
        have decent caculation skills, and a quick learner. Patience and among other skills
       related to children was picked up with dealing with my insufferable sister. I also
        have expereince with Public Speaking and entertaining my audiance. My time spent
        at toastmaster could prove to be useful when it comes to extremly bored students 
        who are forced to attend Kumon by their parents. </p>
        <p>As a fomer ex-Kumon student, I feel obligated to earn back the money that my dad
        spent on trying get me to become a faster caculater. My Resume is in the next page and you can contact me  through facebook, github, twitter, discord, skype email or text message..</p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
        <p>Best Regards</p>
        <p>Narissara Namkhan.</p>
