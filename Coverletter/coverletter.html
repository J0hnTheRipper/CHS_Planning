        <p>Dear Mr.John Doe,</p>
        <p> It came to my attention that the Kumon Assistant position is avaliable for most people. 
          Your notice on the www.indeed.com website have worked. As you are well aware, there's 
          over 26  applicants applying for the job. Out of all the applicants, there's a reason
          why you will pick me over others to be the sole assistant of the Kumon Program. </p>
        <p>It was a long time ago, but Kumon was a place where I would attend weekly. I have 
          gotten a bit too reliant on caculators, and my grades start suffering from the
          "no-caculator-rule". </p>
        <p> Why do you want the job</p>
        <p>CLosing/Summary-Restate your interest in the position. Mention your enclosed Resume and contact details ie #Tel and emial.</p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
        <p>Best Regards</p>
        <p>Narissara Namkhan.</p>
