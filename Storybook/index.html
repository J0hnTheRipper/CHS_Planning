            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As you can guess, Sara is a semi-intelligent being. After all,
            she wouldn't be able to write this if she wasn't a human being.
            Well, there's a possibility that she could be an alien in disguise.
            However, we can assure you that she is in no way an alien...Or is
            she? :)</p><img align="left" height="300" src="img/alien.jpg">

            <h2>Name</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who goes by the name of
            Narissara. Narissara like her name, but the majority of the human
            race are unable to pronounce it. Many times, people forced her to
            repeat her name over and over because they want their pronunciation
            to be perfect. It was exhausting to pretend that they are right.
            The girl eventually decided to shorten her name. Now, people
            referred to her as "Sara".</p><img align="center" height="300" src=

            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>Sara live with her aunt,uncle, and cousins in Thailand. One day,
            the mom re-married and decided that the girl could live in Canada
            with her. A year later, they move to China.After 8 years, the
            family moved back to Canada. Sara took up online schooling
            there.Once the paperwork was cleared up, Sara was allowed to attend
            any school in Canada. The girl chose Clayton heights due to it's
            close proximity to her house and the free wifi that come along with
            it.</p><img align="center" height="500px" src=

            "img/.jpg">
            <p>While Sara would very much like to talk about her love for both
            functional and imperative languages, this would become a very
            boring presentation indeed. So for the sake of entertainment, let's
            talk about her unsual hobbies that usually consist of: provoking
            people, debating, reverse debugging,and silently judging observing
            people behaviours.</p>
