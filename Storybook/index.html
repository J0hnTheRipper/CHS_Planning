	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As you can guess, Sara is a semi-intelligent being. After all, she wouldn't be able to write this if she wasn't a human being. Well, there's a possibility that she could be an alien in disguise. However, we can assure you that she is in no way an alien...Or is she? :)</p>

	<h2>Name</h2>
	<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who goes by the name of Narissara. Narissara like her name, but the majority of the human race are unable to pronounce it. Many times, people forced her to repeat her name over and over because they want their pronunciation to be perfect. It was exhausting to pretend that they are right. The girl eventually decided to shorten her name. Now, people referred to her as "Sara".</p>

	    <h2>Past</h2>
	     <p>Sara live with her aunt,uncle, and cousins in Thailand. One day, the mom re-married and decided that the girl could live in Canada with her. A year later, they move to China.After 8 years, the family moved back to Canada. Sara took up online schooling there.Once the paperwork was cleared up, Sara was allowed to attend any school in Canada. The girl chose Clayton heights due to it's close proximity to her house and the free wifi that come along with it.</p>

		<p>
		While Sara would very much like to talk about her love for both functional and imperative languages, this would become a very boring presentation indeed. So for the sake of entertainment, let's talk about her unsual hobbies that usually consist of: provoking people, debating, reverse debugging,and silently judging observing people behaviours. On the other hand, most of the stuffSara enjoys doing either greatly distrubed people or makes them want to stangle her..</p>

		<h2>10 Attributes </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Sara is resourceful.She may have terrible face, vocal, and name recognition skill. Would often ask people for their facebook and instagram profiles so she can always look at her phone everytime Sara forgets the person name when she's talking with them. </li>
			<li> Sara have the tendency to procastinate until the very last moment.. However, no one knows this, which speaks a lot about her ablity to remain calm under a short deadline while producing a quality work.  </li>
